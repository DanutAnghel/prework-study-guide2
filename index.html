  <p><strong>Bucharest</strong> <em>Romanian: București</em>  is the capital and largest city of Romania, as well as its cultural, industrial, and financial centre. It is located in the southeast of the country, on the banks of the Dâmbovița River, less than 60 km (37.3 mi) north of the Danube River and the Bulgarian border.</p>
  <p>After 1716, government was no longer in the hands of native princes but was controlled instead by Phanariotes (i.e., Greeks originating in the Phanar district of Constantinople). In 1821 Bucharest was the centre of a popular uprising, led by the Walachian national hero Tudor Vladimirescu, which ended Phanariote rule. Again, in 1848 and 1859, civic unrest in the city played a part in bringing about the union of Walachia and Moldavia, followed in 1862 by the proclamation of Bucharest as the capital of the Romanian state. These events, coupled with a land reform in 1864 and the final achievement of national independence in the war of 1877–78, gave a strong impetus to the economic development of both the country and its capital city.

After World War I, Bucharest strengthened its position as the most important city of a greatly enlarged country. Further growth took place after World War II, and, following the nationalization of business and industry beginning in 1948, this growth was characterized by large-scale projects and a marked architectural uniformity.

The modern city is characterized by a number of squares from which streets and boulevards radiate. The two chief streets, running roughly parallel through the centre of the city, are Calea Victoriei and Bulevardul Magheru. Bulevardul Unirii, formerly called, under communism, the “Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism,” was vastly expanded in the 1980s under the dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and was bordered by such buildings as the palatial marble House of the People (Casa Poporului, now the Palace of the Parliament). About 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) of old Bucharest were razed to make room for the new palace and grand boulevard.</p>

  <figcaption>Piața Unirii ( Unification Square or Union Square in English) is one of the largest squares in central Bucharest, Romania, located in the center of the city where Sectors 1, 2, 3, and 4 meet. Part of the Civic Centre, it is bisected by Unirii Boulevard, originally built during the Communist era as the Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, and renamed after the Romanian Revolution.</figcaption>

      <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>What shapes a country is often the religious aspects of its people. The churches are where the population gathers for worship in their chosen faith, bringing them closer together and strengthening the community. The people of Bucharest are quite devoted to their chosen religion, and that is reflected in the fact that approximately 86.8% of the population is Eastern Orthodox. Other religions in Bucharest are Protestantism, which makes up 7.5% of the total population and Roman Catholicism, which accounts for 4.7% of the population.The Eastern Orthodox Church is the largest religious denomination in Romania, numbering 16,307,004 according to the 2011 census, or 81.04% of the population. The rate of church attendance is, however, significantly lower. According to a poll conducted by INSCOP in July 2015, 37.8% of Romanians who declare themselves to be religious go to church only on major holidays, 25.4% once a week (especially on Sunday), 18.9% once a month, 10.2% once a year or less, 3.4% say they do not go to church, 2.7% a few times a week, and only 0.9% say they go to church daily.</p>
